# BoiLit

The Boiler Plate Kit for Lit. The name is somewhat obvioulsy derived from the term "boiler plate" and "Lit" to become "BoiLit". This was inspired by the lack of response when attempting to be a contributor to the official [Lit Typescript Starter Kit](https://github.com/lit/lit-element-starter-ts). I tried to make it as straight forward as possible to install and understand what is happening.

### Contributing

Anyone that would like to contribute, feel free to put in a pull request.

### Installation

If you do not have Yarn, install it, and then `yarn install`. Make a copy of `.env.example` into `.env`.

### Development Server

[Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) is the current dev server. It is configured to open the browser and hotload when files are changed.

To start the server run `yarn dev`. Happy sandboxing!

### Routing Package

I have created a router package called [BoiLit Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@larzilla/boilit-router) that supperts [Lit 2.x](https://lit.dev). You can find the source at [BoiLit Router GitHub](https://github.com/jason-horvath/boilit-router).
